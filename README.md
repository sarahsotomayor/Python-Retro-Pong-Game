# Python-Retro-Pong-Game
Retro Pong Game
<br>

### Technologies
* Language: Python 3
* Library: Turtle
<br>

### Sound Source
[Mixkit](https://mixkit.co)
<br>

### Tutorial Source
This was a freecodecamp tutorial by @TokyoEdTech on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w)
<br>

### Future plans
- [ ] I would like to modularize the game and use OOP
- [ ] Use playsound instead of os module. Currently, the playsound module has a delay issue that I have not been able to fix so I am using the os module as the tutorial shows. 
- [ ] I would also like to add different levels and a high score window.
